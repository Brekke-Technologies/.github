## ‚öôÔ∏è Operations

### Planned Meetings
#### Issue Planning
This begins as soon as a contract is signed for a project. The project should be created within Gtihub titled the project with a descirption that aligns with the project. As an entire team we walk through the business requirements outlined in the contract and develop high-level issues. Individually we will go through each issue and outline the descirption and acceptance criteria. A point estimate is assigned to the issue. The issues are then slotted to an iteration.
#### Weekly Recap
This meeting is performed weekly to check the high-level status of a project, discuss any blockers, and discuss any updates to the timeline for our customers.

### Communication
Using the discussion within the issue and MR's, any information about blockers, questions about the issues, and suggestions to the code. This provides a seamless discussion experience that focuses on flexiblity while minimizing meetings. Communication should be kept as close to Github as possible instead of IM or Email.

### Engineer Workflow
As soon as a project begins each engineer should review the entirity of the project and understand the priority and work required. If this is not clear, questions should be asked within the discussion of the issue. The engineer should assign themeselves to the first of the prioritized issues and begin work. If there is a need to split up, add, or udpate an issue, a discussion with the PO should happen preferrably through the issue discussion.
