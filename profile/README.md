## ‚öôÔ∏è Operations

### Planned Meetings
#### Issue Planning
Issue planning starts as soon as a contract is signed for a project. The project should be created within GitHub, titled appropriately, with a description that aligns with the project. The entire team will walk through the business requirements outlined in the contract and develop high-level issues. Each issue will be individually detailed with a description and acceptance criteria, and assigned a point estimate. The issues are then slotted into an iteration.
#### Weekly Recap
This weekly meeting checks the high-level status of a project, discusses any blockers, and updates the timeline for our customers.

### Communication
Communication should be conducted within the issue and merge request discussions. This includes information about blockers, questions about the issues, and code suggestions. This approach provides a seamless discussion experience that focuses on flexibility while minimizing meetings. Communication should be kept as close to GitHub as possible, instead of using IM or email.

### Engineer Workflow
At the start of a project, each engineer should review the entire project to understand the priorities and required work. If anything is unclear, questions should be asked within the issue discussion. Engineers should assign themselves to the first prioritized issue and begin work. If there is a need to split up, add, or update an issue, a discussion with the PO should occur, preferably through the issue discussion.
